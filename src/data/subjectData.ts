## Numbers 1 to 100

### Let's Learn About Numbers!
Numbers are all around us! We use them every day to count objects, tell time, and measure things.

### Counting from 1 to 20:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

### Try this fun activity:
Count the fingers on your hands. How many do you have? That's right - 10!
* 5 fingers on your left hand
* 5 fingers on your right hand
* 5 + 5 = 10 fingers total

### Counting by 10s to 100:
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100

![Image of numbers arranged in tens blocks]

### Real-Life Examples:
* The number of students in your class
* Your age in years
* The number of rupees in your piggy bank
* How many mangoes are in a basket

### Fun Counting Game:
When you're at the beach in Mauritius, try counting:
* How many shells can you find?
* How many waves come to shore in one minute?
* How many seabirds you can see?

Remember: Numbers help us understand how many things we have!`,

        title: 'Basic Addition and Subtraction',
        content: `# Addition and Subtraction
        
## Let's Add and Subtract!

### Addition (+) means putting things together
When we add, the number gets bigger!

#### Example 1:
If you have 3 mangoes and your friend gives you 2 more, how many do you have now?
3 + 2 = 5 mangoes

#### Example 2:
Let's add using pictures:
üçé + üçé + üçé = 3 apples
üçå + üçå = 2 bananas
All fruit together: 3 + 2 = 5 fruits

### Subtraction (-) means taking away
When we subtract, the number gets smaller!

#### Example 1:
If you have 7 sweets and you eat 3, how many are left?
7 - 3 = 4 sweets

#### Example 2:
Let's subtract using pictures:
üê¢üê¢üê¢üê¢üê¢ (5 turtles)
If 2 turtles swim away: üê¢üê¢üê¢ (3 turtles remain)
5 - 2 = 3 turtles

### Number Bonds to 10
These are pairs of numbers that add up to 10:
* 1 + 9 = 10
* 2 + 8 = 10
* 3 + 7 = 10
* 4 + 6 = 10
* 5 + 5 = 10

### Try These Problems:
1. You have 4 pencils. Your teacher gives you 3 more. How many pencils do you have now?
2. There are 8 birds on a tree. 5 fly away. How many birds are left on the tree?
3. You pick 6 flowers. Your sister picks 4 flowers. How many flowers do you have together?

Remember: + means add, - means subtract!`,

        title: 'Multiplication Tables',
        content: `# Multiplication Tables
        
## Multiplication is Repeated Addition

Multiplication helps us add the same number many times very quickly!

### What is Multiplication?
* 3 √ó 4 means "3 groups of 4" or "4 added 3 times"
* 3 √ó 4 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

### Let's see multiplication with pictures:
üçéüçéüçé  (1 row of 3 apples)
üçéüçéüçé  (2 rows of 3 apples)
üçéüçéüçé  (3 rows of 3 apples)
üçéüçéüçé  (4 rows of 3 apples)

This shows 4 √ó 3 = 12 apples total!

### The 2 Times Table:
2 √ó 1 = 2  (Two taken once is 2)
2 √ó 2 = 4  (Two taken twice is 4)
2 √ó 3 = 6  (Two taken three times is 6)
2 √ó 4 = 8  (Two taken four times is 8)
2 √ó 5 = 10 (Two taken five times is 10)
2 √ó 6 = 12 (Two taken six times is 12)
2 √ó 7 = 14 (Two taken seven times is 14)
2 √ó 8 = 16 (Two taken eight times is 16)
2 √ó 9 = 18 (Two taken nine times is 18)
2 √ó 10 = 20 (Two taken ten times is 20)

### The 5 Times Table:
5 √ó 1 = 5
5 √ó 2 = 10
5 √ó 3 = 15
5 √ó 4 = 20
5 √ó 5 = 25
5 √ó 6 = 30
5 √ó 7 = 35
5 √ó 8 = 40
5 √ó 9 = 45
5 √ó 10 = 50

### Multiplication in Mauritius:
If one sugar cane gives 8 cups of juice, how many cups of juice can you get from 5 sugar canes?
5 √ó 8 = 40 cups of juice!

### Easy Multiplication Tricks:
* Multiplying by 10: Just add a zero! (7 √ó 10 = 70)
* Multiplying by 5: First multiply by 10, then divide by 2
  Example: 6 √ó 5 = (6 √ó 10) √∑ 2 = 60 √∑ 2 = 30
* Multiplying by 2: Just double the number!
  Example: 9 √ó 2 = 9 + 9 = 18

### Practice at Home:
Count objects in your house in groups, like:
* How many eggs are in 3 egg cartons if each has 6 eggs? (3 √ó 6 = 18)
* If each hand has 5 fingers, how many fingers do 4 people have? (4 √ó 10 = 40)`,

        title: 'Fractions and Decimals',
        content: `# Fractions and Decimals
        
## Parts of a Whole

### What are Fractions?
A fraction shows part of a whole. It has:
* **Numerator** (top number): How many parts we have
* **Denominator** (bottom number): Total equal parts in the whole

### Examples with Pictures:
üçïüçïüçïüçï (A pizza cut into 4 equal slices)
If you eat 1 slice, you've eaten 1/4 of the pizza.
If you eat 3 slices, you've eaten 3/4 of the pizza.

#### More Examples:
* Half of a mango = 1/2
* Three-quarters of a chocolate bar = 3/4
* Two-thirds of a glass of water = 2/3

### Types of Fractions:
* **Proper fractions**: Numerator smaller than denominator (1/2, 3/4)
* **Improper fractions**: Numerator larger than denominator (5/3, 7/4)
* **Mixed numbers**: Whole number and proper fraction (1 1/2, 2 3/4)

### Fractions in Everyday Life in Mauritius:
* Recipe for dholl puri needs 1/2 cup of split peas
* A journey from Port Louis to Grand Baie takes 3/4 hour
* 1/4 kg of vegetables at the market

### Decimals - Another Way to Show Parts
Decimals use a point to separate whole numbers from parts of a whole.

#### Converting Simple Fractions to Decimals:
* 1/2 = 0.5
* 1/4 = 0.25
* 3/4 = 0.75
* 1/10 = 0.1
* 7/10 = 0.7

### Decimal Place Value:
* Tenths: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3...
* Hundredths: 0.01, 0.02, 0.03...
* Thousandths: 0.001, 0.002, 0.003...

### Money Uses Decimals:
* 1 Rupee = Rs 1.00
* 50 cents = Rs 0.50
* 25 cents = Rs 0.25

### Try These Problems:
1. If you eat 2 slices of a pizza that has 8 equal slices, what fraction of the pizza did you eat?
2. Convert 3/5 to a decimal.
3. Which is larger: 0.7 or 2/3?
4. If a recipe calls for 3/4 cup of sugar and you're making half the recipe, how much sugar do you need?

Remember: Fractions and decimals are just different ways to show parts of a whole!`,
